# New Zealand Bicycle Accidents ðŸš² 

A (so-far) simple map of bicycle accidents across New Zealand, partly inspired and spurred on by a personal bike accident back in 2019. 

Data is taken from over 500,000 road traffic accidents between 2000-2020, taken from the Crash Analysis System (CAS) from Waka Kotahi, available on the Open Data Portal at https://opendata-nzta.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=CAS
